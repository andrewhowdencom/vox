# How to Find Required Tools

Make sure you have any tools required to build, compile or otherwise maintain the application by reviewing the
file called README.md for instructions on the installation of any tools.

Common tools include things like:

* git
* [task] (see [How to Use Taskfile](../task-runner/how-to-use-taskfile.md))

[task]: https://taskfile.dev/docs/installation
